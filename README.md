# Hi, I'm Patrick Guidry 👋  
**Aspiring Cybersecurity Analyst | Security+ Certified | SOC & Blue Team Focus**

I'm transitioning into cybersecurity after 10+ years of high-pressure, operations-driven work in the hospitality industry. I’m currently developing a hands-on security portfolio focused on SOC investigations, Linux log analysis, and foundational threat detection skills.

I completed the **Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate** and I've recently earned my **CompTIA Security+** certification. My goal is to earn my first role as a **SOC Analyst**, **Cybersecurity Analyst**, or **IT → Security hybrid** position in the Houston area.
